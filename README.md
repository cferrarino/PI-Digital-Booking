Final Project for the Certified Tech Developer course of studies provided by Digital House, created in collaboration with Mercado Libre and Globant.

This project is a website in the style of booking.com, where a logged in user can choose from a wide variety of places to stay, and an admin can create new lodging using a form. 

This app was developed using React, HTML5, CSS3, Java, SpringBoot and MySQL.
